# Topic-modeling

The topic modelling is performed to seggregate the text articles into different buckets/categories. Its a unsupervised approach to understand the broader picture of text. 
I have performed web scraping on a random news website to seggregate the news records. We may use it to tell if its a finance news, sports news, commodity news, weather news etc.
